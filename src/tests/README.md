make test will run all tests (I guess).


The tests are organised as follow:

* benchmarks -- performance related tests
* encore -- tests of programs written in the Encore language
* pony -- additional tests for the pony backend and whatever extensions we make
* compiler --- unit tests for the compiler source (contrast with encore)

The lib directory contains whatever support is needed to run the tests.
